## Week 03 Overview — NLP & Language Translation

From Words to Meaning

This week, we begin working directly with language as data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one of the most mature and widely used areas of deep learning, powering translation systems, chatbots, search engines, and AI assistants. Our focus this week is language translation, using it as a concrete way to understand how modern NLP systems work in practice.

You are not expected to master the mathematics of attention or transformers. Instead, you will focus on how these systems are used, evaluated, and integrated into real workflows.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 03, you should be able to:

	•	Explain what Natural Language Processing (NLP) is and where it is used
	•	Describe, at a high level, how attention-based models enable translation
	•	Use AI tools to perform language translation tasks
	•	Evaluate translation output for accuracy, nuance, and limitations
	•	Connect NLP techniques to real-world applications in art, culture, and accessibility

### Tools You’ll Use This Week

	•	Jupyter Notebooks
	•	Python translation libraries
	•	AI translation services
	•	NotebookLM (for summarizing and studying concepts)
	•	GitHub (for notebooks and lab instructions)

###  What You’ll Do This Week

	1.	Review core NLP concepts and examples
	2.	Explore how attention-based models support translation
	3.	Run translation notebooks using provided tools
	4.	Translate a real-world text related to the CU Art Museum
	5.	Analyze where translation succeeds and where it struggles

###  Deliverables

	•	Art Museum Translation Assignment (Canvas submission)

⚠️ Focus on reasoning about output quality, not just generating translations.

###  Estimated Time Commitment

	•	Concept review & slides: ~2 hours
	•	Lab & assignment work: ~2–3 hours

### Final Note

Translation is a powerful demonstration of what AI can do — and what it still gets wrong.

Pay attention to:

	•	Tone
	•	Cultural context
	•	Ambiguity
	•	Errors that look “confident” but are incorrect

These limitations will resurface throughout the course in more advanced systems.


### Coming Next

Next week, we step back and look at AI in practice:

	•	AI trends
	•	Agile workflows
	•	Design thinking
	•	How real AI projects succeed (or fail)

You’re now officially “in the course.”
