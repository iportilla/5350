## Week 01 Overview — Course Orientation & Tooling

Welcome to STAT 5350: Applied Deep Learning

This week is about getting oriented, not being overwhelmed.

Applied Deep Learning is a hands-on course that focuses on how AI systems are actually built, deployed, and evaluated in the real world. Before we dive into models, we need to make sure everyone is set up with the tools, workflows, and expectations that will carry us through the semester.

Think of this week as laying the foundation.


🎯 Learning Objectives  

By the end of Week 01, you should be able to:
	•	Understand the scope, structure, and expectations of the course
	•	Navigate Canvas and know where to find weekly materials
	•	Use AI tools (HiTA, NotebookLM) to support your learning
	•	Confirm access to core collaboration tools (Slack, GitHub)
	•	Run a simple Deep Learning–related exercise to get started



🛠 Tools You’ll Use This Week
	•	Canvas – course hub
	•	HiTA – AI assistant for course support
	•	NotebookLM – summarization, FAQs, study support
	•	Slack – class communication
	•	GitHub – identity, collaboration, and portfolio
	•	Python / VS Code – basic environment check

No prior deep learning expertise is required — we will build up skills progressively.


🧪 What You’ll Do This Week
	1.	Review the syllabus and course structure
	2.	Explore HiTA and NotebookLM using the course syllabus
	3.	Join the class Slack workspace
	4.	Confirm your GitHub presence
	5.	Complete a short Deep Learning Intro Exercise


📤 Deliverables
	•	DL Intro Exercise (Canvas submission)
	•	Class spreadsheet completed (email + GitHub ID)

⚠️ This week is primarily about access and orientation. If something doesn’t work, that’s expected — ask questions early.


⏱ Estimated Time Commitment
	•	Reading & exploration: ~2 hours
	•	Setup & exercise: ~2–3 hours


💬 Final Note

If you feel slightly uncomfortable this week, that’s normal.
If you feel completely lost, please speak up — this course is designed to support learning, not gatekeep it.
