## Week 04 Overview — AI in Practice: Trends, Agile & Design Thinking

From Models to Systems

So far, we’ve focused on tools and techniques. This week, we step back and ask a different question:

How do AI projects actually succeed in the real world?

Many AI efforts fail not because the models are bad, but because of poor problem framing, weak processes, unrealistic expectations, or misaligned teams. This week focuses on the human, organizational, and process side of AI.

This is a critical transition point in the course.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 04, you should be able to:

	•	Identify current trends and predictions in AI
	•	Distinguish hype from realistic AI capabilities
	•	Explain the CRISP-DM framework for AI projects
	•	Understand the roles of Agile and Scrum in applied AI work
	•	Apply design thinking to frame AI problems around real users

### Tools You’ll Use This Week

	•	Industry articles & reports
	•	CRISP-DM framework
	•	Agile / Scrum concepts
	•	Mural (collaborative design)
	•	Canvas discussion & reflection tools

This week is concept-heavy and collaboration-focused rather than code-heavy.

### What You’ll Do This Week

	1.	Review current AI trend articles and predictions
	2.	Identify realistic vs exaggerated claims about AI
	3.	Learn how AI projects are structured using CRISP-DM
	4.	Participate in an Agile retrospective exercise
	5.	Use design thinking to analyze an AI problem from a user perspective

### Deliverables

	•	AI Predictions Summary (top insights from readings)
	•	Poster / Retrospective submission

⚠️ Clear thinking matters more than technical depth this week.

### Estimated Time Commitment

	•	Reading & concept review: ~2–3 hours
	•	Group work & reflection: ~2 hours

### Final Note

This week may feel less “technical,” but it is foundational.

Understanding:

	•	What problem to solve
	•	Who you’re solving it for
	•	How teams collaborate

often matters more than model selection.

Strong AI practitioners think in systems, not just code.

### Coming Next

Next week, we return to hands-on work with Coding with AI:

	•	AI-assisted programming
	•	Low-code workflows
	•	How AI changes the act of writing software

This is where many students experience a major productivity shift.
